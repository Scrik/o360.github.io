# Open360 P2P Feedback Software

Open360 helps HR personnel in various organizations design, plan and run P2P feedback events. It's based on well-known [360 degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback) feedback approach. 

It was initially developed by [Bitworks Software](https://bitworks.software/) for internal purposes in 2016 and released to open source in 2020. We at Bitworks successfuly use Open360 since 2016, which helped us to improve internal HR processes significantly.
